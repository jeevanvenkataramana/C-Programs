Selection sort

1. start at index 0.

2. search the smallest element in the unsorted list.

3. swap the smallest value with position 0

4. make similar N-1 passes over a list of N numbers.  



Insertion sort( arranging cards)

1. At pass 1 sort 1st and 2nd element.

2. take the 3 rd element check with the 2nd element fit to the position it should placed.

3. The array starts to sort from the beginning.

 

Shell sort

1. Like Insertion sort we compare with elements h elements apart.

2. The final value of h is 1



Quick sort





Merge sort

1. well suited for linked lists.

2. List first be split into smaller sublists that can be sorted seperately

Mechanism

1. Pick an arbitrary value in the list.

2. swap with the value to the right end.

3. Set index i to the left end and set j to the right end - 1.

4. Move i right skipping over values less than pivot. and stop when it reaches greater than pivot.

5. Move j left skipping over values greater than pivot. and stop when it reaches lesser than pivot.

6. After both i and j are stopped swap values. at i and j.

7. Once i and j have crossed swap pivot with i position.
