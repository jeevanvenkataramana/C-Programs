Type Casting

Implicit Conversion: Done by compiler on its own

Explicit conversion: forcefully done


float x=1.0;
int sum = (int)x + 1;


Conversion using cast operator

Static cast

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
int main() 
{ 
  float f = 3.5; 
  int b = static_cast<int>(f); 
  cout << b; 
} 

Dynamic cast

Ones that pass compile time but fail during runtime
