Declaration

vector< Type > var_name;

vector< int > v(10);			//first ten elements are initialized to 0,  to set v[10] we should use push_back


In vectors u cannot assign a value to a position unless it had some value before

i.e   to initialize a vector to something first push_back


v.size()		--> returns size of the vector

v.capacity()		--> no of elements for which it currently has memory allocated

v.reserve(value)	--> increases the capacity of the vector

v.resize(value)

v.resize(24)
If the previous size was less than 24, then the new elements are initialized as
we described for the constructor with an integer argument. If the previous size
was greater than 24, then all but the first 24 elements are lost


example : both are same

for (int i = 0; i < ages.size(); i++)
{
    cout << ages[i] << endl;
} 

for (int age : ages)
{
    cout << age << endl;
}
